Kanbas Quizzes Project Requirements
Throughout this semester, we have been exploring various web development technologies, learning the fundamental tools and techniques that bring dynamic and interactive Web applications to life. To practice your development skills, you have been building Kanbas, our class's own version of a learning management system (LMS), inspired by a popular LMS. As we approach the culmination of our course, it's time to challenge yourselves further and extend Kanbas by developing a Quizzes section. This new feature will be a cornerstone of the Kanbas system, facilitating an interactive learning experience and enabling assessment to be seamlessly integrated into the online learning environment.
Authentication and Authorization  
As part of the assignments we have implemented user authentication allowing multiple users to login simultaneously into the Kanbas application. Your implementation of the Quizzes must include support for multiple and simultaneous user signup, signin, and profile. Additionally you need to support two types of users: Faculty and Students. As a Faculty, a user can create, edit, preview, and delete quizzes. As a Student, a user can only view the list of quizzes, take a quiz, and view the final grade of the quiz. To simplify configuring a user's role, you can provide a checkbox or dropdown users can choose when signing up.
Courses per User
When a user logs in, they should only see the courses they are associated with. For instance, in the Dashboard faculty should only see the courses they have created and students should only see the courses they are enrolled in. In the assignments we implemented the signin and course creation process so associating courses with the currently logged in user should be simple. For students, you'll need to create a mechanism for them to enroll into a course. One suggestion would be that their Dashboard is initially empty since they are not enrolled in any course, but they can click on some link that would take them to a list of all the courses available from which they can choose which courses they want to enroll in. Then back in their Dashboard, they would only see the courses they are enrolled in. Clicking the course from the Dashboard takes a user to the Home screen of the course. Faculty can edit the content in a course, but students can not.
Quiz List Screen
Implement a Quizzes screen that display a list of quizzes as shown below. The Quizzes screen displays the quizzes for the current course. If a user navigates to a different course from the Dashboard, they would see a different list of quizzes.

Quiz Preview screen
The Quiz Preview screen allow faculty to view the quiz as students would see the quiz. The faculty can answer the quiz and view the score they would get with the answers they provided. The answers are stored in the database for the user that took the quiz so that next time the faculty previews the quiz, they can see when and what they answered the last time they took the quiz. Faculty can not edit the quiz while they are taking the quiz. To edit the quiz they can click on a button Edit Quiz that navigates them to the Quiz Questions Editor screen described earlier.
  Persist Student Quiz Answers and Scores
Although faculty can edit and preview a quiz, a student can not edit a quiz, but can take the quiz as many times as configured in the How Many Attempts property in the Quiz Details screen. The answers to the quiz are stored per student so that they can come back later and see the when they took the quiz, what score they got, and what they answered the last time they took the quiz. Questions are highlighted as green or checkmark if they were correctly answered, and red or X if they were answered incorrectly. Students can't change the answers of a quiz they already took. They can take the quiz again if Multiple Attempts is configured and as many times as configured in How Many Attempts. Once a student has exhausted the number of attempts, they can not take the quiz again. Students can only see the answers and score to the last attempt. If another student takes the quiz, their answers are stored separately so that when they submit their answers and then comeback to view the results, they can see what they answered in their last attempt.
